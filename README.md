### What I'm building

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [psst](https://github.com/Michaelliv/psst) | AI-native secrets manager — agents use secrets without seeing them |
| [9to5](https://github.com/Michaelliv/9to5) | Automated agents for Claude Code — schedule, webhook, or on-demand |
| [nanny](https://github.com/Michaelliv/nanny) | The dumb task loop for smart agents |
| [handoff](https://github.com/Michaelliv/handoff) | macOS clipboard manager for sharing between humans and AI agents |

### What I write about

Agent architecture, tool design, context engineering, sandboxing, and the craft of building with LLMs.
